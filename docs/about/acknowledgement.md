# Acknowledgments

Users are required to give acknowledgement to the ilifu facility in all publications or communications related to their use of the ilifu facility’s resources.

Please make use of the following acknowledgement statements where appropriate.

## ilifu Acknowledgement

We acknowledge the use of the ilifu cloud computing facility – www.ilifu.ac.za, a partnership between the University of Cape Town, the University of the Western Cape, Stellenbosch University, Sol Plaatje University and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. The ilifu facility is supported by contributions from the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA – a partnership between the University of Cape Town, the University of Pretoria and the University of the Western Cape), the Computational Biology division at UCT and the Data Intensive Research Initiative of South Africa (DIRISA).

## Use of IDIA Software & Facilities

### IDIA pipeline
This work was carried out using the data processing pipelines developed at the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA) and available at https://idia-pipelines.github.io (DOI: [10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560276](https://dx.doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560276)). IDIA is a partnership of the University of Cape Town, the University of Pretoria and the University of the Western Cape.

### CARTA
This work made use of the CARTA (Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy) software (DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3377984](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3377984) - https://cartavis.github.io).

### Visualisation Lab
This work made use of the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA) visualization lab https://vislab.idia.ac.za. IDIA is a partnership of the University of Cape Town, the University of Pretoria and the University of the Western Cape.

### iDaVIE
This work made use of the iDaVIE-v (immersive Data Visualisation Interactive Explorer for volumetric rendering) software (DOI – [10.5281/zenodo.4614116](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4614115) – https://idavie.readthedocs.io).

## MeerKAT 

Please make sure to include the following acknowledgement in each paper which uses MeerKAT data:

The MeerKAT telescope is operated by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, which is a facility of the National Research Foundation, an agency of the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation.

## Other software
Most publicly available software installed on ilifu documents how to acknowledge its usage. Where your usage of the software in a publication is major, it is recommended to cite an ADS entry and/or add a link to its public software repository (e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) or documentation within the body of the publication. Where that is not possible, software usage may be more informally acknowledged within the body of the publication and/or in the acknowledgements section.

## Presentations
When presenting your research in a public forum, please include logos or website links on your title slides or on slides where IDIA or ilifu facilities have been used during your research, such as screenshots or plots produced by CARTA or iDaVIE. Logos of the different facilities or software are available at the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/idia-astro/logos_public).
