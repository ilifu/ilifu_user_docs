# Requesting Help

In the course of your Ilifu work you may have technical enquiries. This could be, but not limited to, the creating of virtual machines, accessing storage, issues with running your jobs on the cluster, etc.

If you feel that you have an issue that you would like the technical staff to have a look at, feel free to send a mail to [support@ilifu.ac.za](mailto:support@ilifu.ac.za) with a **_detailed description of the issue_**.

You can also feel free to use the Ilifu Slack channel, but you will be asked to create a ticket by sending the email as mentioned above regardless.

The Ilifu ticket system is hosted at [Ilifu Helpdesk Website](https://helpdesk.ilifu.ac.za/). Access to the helpdesk portal requires an active ilifu account. New tickets can be created directly there and you can also obtain a view of your historical tickets.
